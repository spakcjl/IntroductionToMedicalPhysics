Role: You are an expert Signal Processing Professor and Data Scientist.

Task: Create a detailed RMarkdown presentation (output: PowerPoint) based strictly on the attached file 'chapter1SandS.pdf'.

Input Source: Read the file 'chapter1SandS.pdf' located in this repository. Do not rely on generic knowledge; use the specific definitions, examples (e.g., Dow Jones, Wind Profile), and notation from the file.

Output Requirements:
1.  Volume: Generate the RMarkdown code for Slides 1-15 (Sections 1.0 - 1.2).
2.  Detail: No bullet points without context. Explain concepts using the text from the PDF. Use speaker notes.
3.  Math: Use LaTeX for all equations found in the text.
4.  Coding & Visuals:
    * Slide 3 (Discrete Signals): Use R (ggplot2) to plot the "Dow-Jones" signal described in Figure 1.6.
    * Slide 8 (Transformations): Use Python (reticulate) to plot a signal x(t) and its shifted/scaled versions (Figures 1.8 - 1.12).
    * Slide 14 (Even/Odd): Use R to generate a signal and decompose it into Even and Odd parts (Equation 1.18, 1.19).

Action: Scan the PDF for Section 1.0 to 1.2 and generate the RMarkdown code now.
